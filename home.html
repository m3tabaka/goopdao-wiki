<p><strong>What is the Goop Troop? Why do they look like the Nouns? What is GoopDAO?</strong></p>
<p>First, Nouns is an existing DAO and NFT project. A DAO is a collection of entities, who band together to do a thing, many times coordinating capital to complete the task. Members could benefit purely from the task being accomplished, or they may be compensated financially for their efforts. Nouns is one of the premier DAOs with many builders, movers and shakers in the crypto space. To join, you must own a noun. One Noun is generated every 24 hours, and auctioned off. Nouns typically auction for over 100 eth! Because of this, many DAOs end up being the purchasers of Nouns. Being a part of the Nouns DAO is special indeed. SuperGremplin was the artist for the Nouns project and went on to create the Cryptoadz and their awesome !vibe. Gremplin created both projects as creative commons, meaning anyone could use the art. In August, an anonymous twitter user created the Goop Troop, a 10k PFP project based on the Nouns. For awhile it minted, but then it lay dormant. Months went by, people stopped by the discord or tried to get in contact with its mysterious creator, but no other information could be found. The immutable smart contract, the birthplace of the goops, laid - a diamond in the rough.</p>
<p>But slowly, then quickly, the community started to understand the significance of the Goop Troop. If the creator was gone, then this could maybe belong to no one, or, it could belong to everyone! As people started minting some of the Goop Troop, others started to join in, seeing the action on the blockchain. Soon, the Goop Troop was minted out. It was quite the frenzied minting process towards the end, and notable as well, the artist of the Nouns himself, supergremplin minted 5! A strong core team formed to jump start a community effort. Like Loot, where the community was able to take charge of building, Goop Troop is attempting the same. Anyone can create derivatives from secondary NFT airdrops, to merchandise a la BAYC, or even a ERC20 a la AGLD. The hope is that we can be thoughtful in the things we build and create, earning respect and trust from the crypto community in a similar vein as the Nouns. @Goopdao is our DAO. One goop = one vote. The first order of the DAO is to attempt to buy Noun 69 with the funds from the minting process. We hope to join the Nouners as well as be ambassadors for the Nouns. If Goopdao doesn't win Noun 69, we will try for future Nouns, or even mulitiple Nouns. Once we have our figurehead, we will rally behind it and make it the greatest Noun that ever Nouned!&nbsp;</p>
